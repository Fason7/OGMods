say 2 "Note" "While digging in the C quadrant of the Therium, Hansel discovered something most extraordinary - a previously unknown clan of subterranean lagomorphs who refer to themselves as Beetles. More research must be conducted, but from what little of our common languages they still share I have gleaned that these Beetles split from our society some centuries previous over petty familial squabbles, and then became trapped underground when the caverns they took shelter in began to collapse around them."
