say 2 "Note" "Spirit energy, [wait 0.3]as told in tales, [wait 0.3]is almost always kept and harnessed within stone lanterns about as tall as any average adult dog."
say 2 "Note" "If these lanterns happen to be broken or destroyed in any way, [wait 0.3]the spirit energy will be released and immediately destroyed; [wait 0.3]any purpose the spirits inside the lantern might've served beforehand vanishes completely, [wait 0.3]and its function is lost forever until replaced."
say 2 "Note" "Along with the spirit energy being permanently lost, [wait 0.3]you will be cursed almost immediately for this 'cardinal sin'."
say 2 "Note" "These spirit lanterns provide functions for every single one of the world's basic principles and law."
