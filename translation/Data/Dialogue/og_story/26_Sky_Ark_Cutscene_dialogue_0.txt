say 1 "Turner" "Sky! You saved me!"
say 2 "Sky" "Of course I did."
say 2 "Sky" "You've been trying to save me for a long time."
say 2 "Sky" "It's time I returned the favor."
say 2 "Sky" "You killed the head of the slaver's guild -- her whole organization is in disarray."
say 2 "Sky" "The cats are setting the slaves free, but they're banishing all rabbits from the city."
say 1 "Turner" "If only we had a safe place to go."
say 1 "Turner" "Somewhere we could start over."
say 2 "Sky" "You can come with me to my home, Sanctuary."
say 2 "Sky" "It's in the clouds, far from the danger below, in a place only rabbits can reach."
say 1 "Turner" "Sky, I'm sorry, but I don't believe it."
say 1 "Turner" "Some city in the heavens?"
say 1 "Turner" "It's just a beautiful dream."
say 2 "Sky" "But it's true."
say 2 "Sky" "I was born there."
say 2 "Sky" "I came down to the surface to explore, but I got lost, and hit my head..."
say 2 "Sky" "Everything was so confused, and I was hurt, and drugged, but now my mind is clear."
say 3 "Rabbit" "She's telling the truth."
say 3 "Rabbit" "I'm from Sanctuary, too."
say 3 "Rabbit" "I was sent to find Sky."
say 3 "Rabbit" "Our city is far to the East."
say 3 "Rabbit" "We can tell you how to get there."
say 2 "Sky" "You'd be welcome."
say 2 "Sky" "And you can start over."
say 1 "Turner" "Can the rebels come too?"
say 1 "Turner" "The slaves from the arena?"
say 2 "Sky" "I don't know, Turner."
say 2 "Sky" "We're very secretive, and wary of outsiders."
say 1 "Turner" "I won't be free until all my people are free, Sky."
say 2 "Sky" "Maybe you can convince the elders to let them join us."
say 2 "Sky" "You can try."
say 2 "Sky" "I'll do what I can to help."
