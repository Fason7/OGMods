# Weapon Switcher
Since the base game doesn't have a weapon switcher I thought I'd make one. Inspired by the weapon switcher in Zelda.  
## Howto install:  
	1. Put the weapon_switcher folder into [Overgrowth Cache folder]/Data/Mods.
## Howto use the weapon switcher:  
	1. While controlling a character use the scrollwheel to select a different weapon.  

Last tested and working on beta 4.
